Letâ€˜s work and project!
Beta Chen &Regular Co-Production.
It's a work which cost us 3-day to clear it's main function and 5-day to maintain and debug.To be honest,our work is very crude.However,we could manage and fuction just by 300 lines functioned codes.It's  a well-done!
If you want to use it,I'd like to say,we haven't product the English Version Release,some Beta is alive,but we don't want to upload.
OK,there are the guides!
First,place your aim .csv files in the folder where the exe is.Second,just typing following the guide words.Then,get what you want.
